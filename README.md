# Node.js, Backbone, Gulp and Browserify Boilerplate Application.
This application is meant to be a boilerplate for starting a Node.js project with Express and Backbone. To run, simply run "npm install", and "bower install" (for bootstrap dependencies) and then run "gulp dev" to kick off the gulp build process.
